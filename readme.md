## My Game - The Coding Turtle


### Game overview
The Coding Turtle is an innovative concept to help people - kids, senior- to improve and speed up their typing skills by playing a simple and entertaining game.

### Game Instructions
1. Player clicks on the START button to launch the game.

2. The main page shows up.
The counter starts from 60.
Characters start appear on the main board.
The users has to press the key related to the character displayed.
A "Play/Pause" button is available at the bottom left corner of the screen.
If the user hits the right key, the scores increases by 1,
If the user hits a wrong key, nothing happens.
If the board gets full of characters, then the game ends.

3. Once the Time counter reaches zero, the "end page" appears with the score count and a "Play Again" button.
There are 3 different version of the end page using different text, images, sounds.

4. If the user clicks on the "Start Again" button, the game starts over.


### Process


  * Brainstorming, searching for a creative idea
  * Thinking of which technologies, methods to use
  * Drawing wireframe and user scenario on paper.
  * Coding the main page, and grid structure with html.
  * Searched online for the icons, images
  * Coding the JavaScript part:
   - Generate random characters appear in random boxes
   - create a score counter, timer clock
   - linking pages / events to each other
  * Styling and restyling:
    -  Adding CSS: colors, effects, repositioning elements
    -  Adding sounds
  * Testing the game all along



### Challenges

One of the challenge was to find a way to switch between the different screens when the user clicks on buttons or make the design responsive.
I spent a lot of time looking for the right sounds, pictures, because the lack of free resources online.

### Wins

I enjoyed styling the game and adding sounds, looking for fun ideas and animation to make the game more lively.
I managed to understand more how jQuery and JS work and modify my functions, use SetInterval and SetTimeout, or transitions for example.. I learnt a lot while having fun.


## Future features

I would like to enhance the game by adding:
    * Responsive design
    * A "combo" feature: the main board will display 3 characters in the same box instead of only 1, so the user will have to   type 3 keys and increase the score by 5 instead of 1.
    * Some animations to the turtle, when the user presses the wrong key.
    * Finding better sound effects
    * Transition animation after the user clicks on "Start" or "Start Again" buttons
    * Levels
